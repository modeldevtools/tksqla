A Small App for Learning the Finer Points of tkinter and SQLAlchemy
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
========

This is the source code that accompanies the blog series "Tk and SQLAlchemy" at
https://heavymetalcoding.com. It was authored and developed because the author
was frustrated with the lack of practical documentation and examples for either
library.

This package is updated regularly as the series is being written. Primarily, it
uses the subject matter of cars. As the title implies, it uses SQLAlchemy to
interact with a SQLite database (including validators for stricter typing), and
tkinter for a GUI. The root Tk() instance acts as the controller - or at least,
tries to, to the best of the author's ability.
